# **Cost-to-Go-UofT**

## **Summary**

**Cost-to-Go-UofT** is a comprehensive tool designed to assist users in planning their study abroad experience. This tool goes beyond merely helping users find a suitable university programâ€”it also provides personalized recommendations for flights and accommodations. Users receive a final itinerary summarizing all the relevant information, making it easier to organize their study abroad plans.

This application was inspired by feedback regarding the University of Toronto's study abroad page, which users often found overwhelming and insufficient. The original page lacked detailed information, such as rental and flight costs, leaving users without a clear picture of the full experience. **Cost-to-Go-UofT** fills these gaps by offering an all-in-one solution.
