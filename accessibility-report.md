**1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:**

- _Principle 1: Equitable Use_
  - The program adheres to equitable use as the program is accessible to a diverse range of users, ensuring that anyone can search for universities, places to stay, and flights without anyone being disadvantaged. Regardless of their background or technical expertise. Its design ensures that all users can input their GPA and other information to find universities they're eligible for without any barriers. By offering features that allow users to find stay accommodations and flights, the program caters to diverse audiences with varying needs. 
- _Principle 2: Flexibility in Use_
  - Users can input various information such as their GPA and program and explore options tailored to their needs, like selecting a university they are interested in. The program accommodates different user preferences, such that the program will offer various study abroad options, display housing options that fit their budgets and locations that meet their preferences. This flexibility ensures that users can tailor their plans to meet their needs.
- _Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use_
  - The interface, built using Java Swing, offers a user-friendly and straightforward navigation system, making tasks like selecting a university or viewing the itinerary easy to understand. Each step is designed to be clear and logical. Users with minimal technical knowledge should be able to quickly understand how the program works as the flow is intuitive and free of unnecessary complexity.
- _Principle 4: Perceptible Information_
  - All necessary details, such as eligibility criteria, accommodation options, and flight information, are presented clearly, ensuring that users can make informed decisions. All critical details, such as GPA requirements for universities and flight details are clearly displayed and easy to comprehend. The use of straightforward language and organized layouts helps users make informed decisions without confusion.
- _Principle 5: Tolerance for Error_ 
  - The program allows users to revise inputs or selections. For example, users can select multiple universities before finalizing their decision or modify their preferences without restarting the entire process. 
- _Principle 6: Low Physical Effort_ 
  - By automating complex tasks, such as filtering eligible universities, integrating with the Airbnb API for accommodation options, and generating a complete itinerary, the amount of manual work required from the user is reduced, ensuring the program is efficient and easy to use.  
- _Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use_
  - The interface is designed such that it should be compatible with different screen sizes. Buttons, frames, and the overall view is appropriately sized and spaced to ensure comfort and accessibility for all users. 


**2. Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.**
- If we were to market this program, we would target university students and young individuals interested in studying abroad and travel planning. This group would include individuals seeking educational opportunities abroad. The program would be ideal for students looking for an efficient way to match their academic qualifications with university requirements while also managing the logistical challenges of moving abroad, such as finding accommodations and convenient flights. This program offers a reliable service that would simplify the study-abroad process. 

**3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.**
- Certain demographics may be less likely to use the program due to barriers in accessibility, resources, or digital literacy. For example, students might lack access to reliable internet or the necessary devices to use the program. Language barriers could also be a concern since the program only supports English, excluding non-English speaking users. Financial constraints may also deter users who cannot afford study-abroad programs or the costs associated with it such as living expenses. To address these considerations, the program could be improved by adding multilingual support and adding a feature that would help users explore financial support options.
